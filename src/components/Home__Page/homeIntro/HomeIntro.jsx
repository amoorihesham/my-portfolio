      <h1 className="mb-4">Hello, i`m Amr Hesham</h1>
      <p>
        Your friendly neighborhood frontend developer, UX architect, and
        JavaScript engineer. I spend my days and often nights painting the
        Internet canvas with <span>projects</span> and lines of code, turning
        zeroes and ones into <span>immersive</span>, interactive{" "}
        <span>experiences</span>,
      </p>
      <p>
        Bona fide photochromic LENS enthusiast - sunlight or indoors, I&#39;ve
        got it covered. I tread the path of minimalism, finding beauty in
        simplicity and order. When I&#39;m not crafting beautiful web
        experiences, you can find me reading ARTICLES or swaying to the rhythm
        of Pop Music & Jazz, losing myself in the captivating flow of melodies.
        anyways you can <span>contact me</span>
      </p>
